Assignment for Coursera: Getting And Cleaning Data 
This repository contains the required submissions for the above assignment. The file run_analysis.R is a script which downloads the source data, carries out various operations to clean and join seperate tables, and export a .txt file showing the averages of 79 metrics grouped by subject and activity. The 79 metrics are any which include the term "mean" or "std", and so indicate the average and standard deviation of the raw data metrics.
The file codeBook contains a breakdown of the metrics included in the original dataset, and so also covers the tidy versions.
